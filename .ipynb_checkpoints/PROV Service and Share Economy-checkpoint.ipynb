    "Say we have $N_A$ and $N_B$ with the public key and private key to be ($PU_A$,$PV_A$) and ($PU_B$, $PV_B$) respectively,  the below steps are only required to be excuted only once for all. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $N_A$ generate a symmetric key $K_S$ (a.k.a. **Sustainable Symmetric Key** or **SSK** ). \n",
    "2. $N_A$ uses asymmetric algorithm $E$,  $PU_B$, metadata $\\lambda$ and signiture function $Sig$ to generate the message $M = Sig(E(PU_B, \\lambda),PV_A)$ , then boardcasts $M$ to blockchain. \n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. PROV Service: Provision, Representation, Orientation and Verification \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "Any service, no matter the consumer and provider parties comes from human community or computer network, can be incontestably processed only when four __predefined__ phases achieved accurate consensus: Provision, Representation, Orientation, Verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provision**: Providers announce the their capacities of handling the services with the rate they can offer, after rational estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation**: Consumer abstracts and refines the requirement from its raw demond, comes up with the standard representation of the task. A good representation should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. avoid any functional or qualitative dispution caused by indistinction or obscuration.\n",
    "2. expose enough and just enough information to support the provider's service, in order to maximize privacy protection and minimize the cost of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orientation**: Consumer compares the providers' offers, picks up the ones with his best interest and assigns the service to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "After  orientation, the providers can untilize any resource and tactic to accomplish the mission. In the service's point of view, there's no interaction, no regulation, no even suggestion. In this way, providers are couraged to maintain competitiveness and innovate to increase the profit space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification**: After the providers believe the mission is accomplished, an predefined verification should be performed. Similar as Representation, verification should avoid any functional or qualitative dispution caused by indistinction or obscuration. The evalution also decides how to dispense the commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mature market model, the phases of P*rovision, Representation* and *Evaluation* are standardized between participated parties, leaving *Orientation* to consumer. In the following chapters, you'll see that in a distributed ledger network, it's better to get *Orientation* process standardized as well, in order to the on chain traffic and protect the providers from Attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A distributed consensus network is **PROV compatiable**, if\n",
    "\n",
    "1. every node  $k$ in this network has an asynmmetric key pair ($PU_k, PV_k$), where $PU_k$ is the public key (address) and $PV_k$ is the private key used for signiture. \n",
    "2. There's a universial currency to measure the value of service. There's a way to calculate the balance of each account. Denote the balance as $b_k$ for node $k$. \n",
    "3. there are $n$ types registered services {$S_n$}, $n \\ge 1$. For any $i \\in [1, n]$, define $S_i \\equiv$  {$P_{S_i},R_{S_i}, O_{S_i}, V_{S_i} , PU_{a_i}, \\vec{\\psi_{S_i}}$}, where $P_{S_i},R_{S_i}, O_{S_i}$ and $V_{S_i} $ are the Provision, Representation, Orientation and Evaluation functions developed to support service $S_i$. $PU_{a_i}$ is $S_i$'s auther's address. $\\vec{\\psi_{S_i}}$ is $S_i$ specific parameters. We call $S_i$ a **PROV Service**.\n",
    "4. Suggest supports *Sustainable Symmetric Key* introduced in *Chapter III*, but not mandatory.\n",

    "### 2.2 PROV Service life cycle\n",
    "In *PROV compatiable network*, A typical life cycle of instance $s \\in S_i$ is described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The service provider node $p$ has resource $\\vec{\\nu}$ (Say storage size, flops, etc.), it estimates it's capacity of running $S_i$ by running $(\\tilde{Cap}^{p}_{S_i},  \\vec{\\rho_{S_i}^p} ) = P_{S_i}(\\vec{\\nu})$. Here $\\tilde{Cap}^{p}_{S_i}$ is calculated for $p$'s reference. $p$ boardcasts an provision message with it's capacity and rate, where $\\vec{\\rho_{S_i}^p} $ is service specific parameters. With $Cap^{p}_{Si} $( $\\le\\tilde{Cap}^{p}_{S_i}$ ) along with rate $Rate^{p}_{Si}$, the message is like: $M_{P}(PU_{p},Cap^{p}_{S_i},Rate^{p}_{S_i}, \\vec{\\rho_{S_i}^p} | PV_p) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consumer node $c$ creates the service instance $s$ by excuting $R_{S_i}$. $(id_s,\\vec{d_s},\\vec{\\alpha_s})=D_{S_i}(\\vec{r_s})$, which preprocesses $c$'s raw input $\\vec{r_s}$ to encrypt sensitive data, standalize the format to generate $\\vec{d_s}$. $id_s$ is $s$'s universal id, $\\vec{\\alpha_s}$ is the answer vector, which can be used for evaluation later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $c$ then calculate $(Vol_s, h_e, \\{PU_{l_p}\\}) = O_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s}) $, where $Vol_s$ is the common estimation of $s$'s volume, $h_v$(a.k.a. **Verification Height**) is the block height deadline for evaluation, and $\\{PU_{l_p}\\}$ is a list (length $l_p$) of  recommended provider's address selected by an algorithm powered by a pseudo-randomizer with the seed generated by $\\vec{d_s}$. In most cases, $O_{S_i}$create a list $L_{P}^{S_i}$ with the addresses of all the providers of $S_i$ by filtering the nodes with $Cap_{Si} \\gt 0$, then iterate every provider $p_j$ with following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Filter out $p_j$ if it's available capacity is less than $Vol_s$. Concretely, say $p_j$ is already working on $l_j$ instances of $S_i$ with the volumes of $\\{Vol_{l_j}\\}$,  filter it out if  $ Cap^{p_j}_{Si} - \\Sigma Vol_{k} \\lt Vols $ \n",
    "\n",
    "   * The fee $p_j​$ required for task $s​$ is calculated by $f(s,p_j) = Rate_{S_i}^{p_j} \\cdot Vol_s​$. Filter out $p_j​$ if $f(s,p_j) \\gt _c​$,b since $c​$ doesn't have enough balance to pay $p_j​$ to run $s​$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * one straightforward practise is to pick $\\{p_j\\}$ where $f(s,p_j)$ has the minimum values (The cheapest ones). Actually, there are other tactics to make more reasonable $O_{S_i}$ utilizing other information recorded on chain. *e.g.* taking the evaluation result from the blockchain of $p_j$'s last 10 services into account, or weight $p_j$'s experience history, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $O_{S_i}$ must utilize a pseudo-randomizer, otherwise it will be easy for the hackers to launch DDoS attack to $p$. If the developer failed to follow this practise, the service is vulnerable and no provider would mount it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   After all these, $c$ boardcasts the orientation message $M_{O}(PU_c,id_s, \\vec{d_s}, \\vec{\\alpha_s}|PV_c)$. Other nodes including selected providers (such as $p$) will get to know $s$ is assigned by calculating $O_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s}) $. \n",
    "\n",
    "   To verify $M_{O}$ during confirmation, bookkeeper nodes should:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Check the signiture. If invalid, return false.\n",
    "   * Run $(Vol_s, \\{PU_p\\}, h_e) = O_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s}) $, check if $p$ has enough available capacity. If not, return false.\n",
    "   * Check if $c$ has enough balance. if not, return false.\n",
    "   * Check if $\\vec{d_s}$ is valid. This is a service specific process.\n",
    "\n",
    "   If everything goes right, $M_{O}$ is recorded into ledger (Say on the height $h_0$). $f(s,p)$ is frozen from $c$'s account immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then it comes to \"B\" phase. $p$ works on the mission by whatever practise, out of the topic' scope here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. $p$ is supposed to give out a result vector $\\vec{z_s}$  before $h_0+h_e$ reached. $p$ can evaluate it's temporary $\\vec{\\zeta}$ anytime by running $({\\upsilon}_s, c_{p_s},c_{a_s} )= E_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s},\\vec{\\zeta}, \\vec{\\alpha_s} )$, where ${\\upsilon}_s \\in [0,1]$ represents the score of $p$'s service. $c_{p_s}$ and $c_{p_s}$ are the presumed service fee deposit to $p$ and $a_i$ 's account. The author $a_i$ can design $E_{S_i}$ to support boolean output 0 and 1 to represent only the status of success and failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "   There's no fixed function to restrict what should $p$ process to get $\\vec{z_s}$, It's free for $p$ to leverge any offchain solution or resource on $s$. But since lack of knowledge of  $\\vec{r}$, $p$ cannot leverage $R_{S_i}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Once $p$ thinks $\\vec{z}$ is OK, it boardcasts the message $M_{E}(id_s, \\vec{z}|PV_p) $. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Then bookkeepers should check \n",
    "\n",
    "   * if latest block height is lower than $h_0+ h_e$. If yes, record the message into ledger. Otherwise just ignore it.\n",
    "   * if 51% $l_{p}$ of the selected providers return same $\\vec{z}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "   By calculating $(v_s, c_{p_s},c_{a_s} )=E_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s},\\vec{z_s}, \\vec{\\alpha_s} ) $, the amount of $F(s,p)$ is unfrozen in $c$'s account, and $ c_{p_s}$ and $c_{a_s}$ are transfered to $p$ and $a_i$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "   The whole life cycle of $s$ is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Solutions of some common scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Large input \n",
    "\n",
    "One common challenge is that many types of services requires the consumer to pass large size data to provider to process. Distributed ledger network with the nature of being a \"ledger\", is neither expected nor feasible to keep large size data. Some off-chain assisted mechanism should be introduced to insure such data is successfully transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say service $S$ has  $\\vec{r} = \\{\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\tau}\\}$ where each element of  $\\vec{\\tau}$ contains large size data, while each element of  $\\vec{\\gamma}$ has small size data. $S$ should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design $D_S$ and $N_S$ to calculate $Vol_s$ irrelative with $\\vec{\\tau}$.  If $Vol_s$ is related with some features of $\\vec{\\tau}$ (say the size), just put the feature values as elements of  $\\vec{\\gamma}$\n",
    "2. $S$ is better not to support manually provider pick up to avoid DDoS. \n",
    "3. Providers should put it's off-chain server addresses into $\\vec{\\rho_{S}} $ in $M_{provision}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When consumer $c$ is creating the new service instance $s$, $D_S$ with input  $\\vec{r}$ goes through following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use the same algorithm of $N_s$ to calculate $Vol_s$ and pick $p$ with an algorithm pseudo-randomized by timestamp $t$.  \n",
    "2. checks if *SSK* (See Chapter 1) between $p$ and $c$ is already created. If not, create it. \n",
    "3. encrypt $\\vec{\\tau'} = E(\\vec{\\tau}, SSK(s,p))$. Post $\\vec{\\tau'} $ with $p$'s off-chain API, $p$ returns $id'_s$ to track $ \\vec{\\tau'} $ . If error happens, go to step 1 and another provider will be picked.\n",
    "4. Calculate $\\vec{d_s} = \\{N'_s(\\vec{\\gamma}),  id'_s, \\epsilon, t\\}$.  $N'_s$ is used to process small size parameter $\\vec{\\gamma}$.  $\\epsilon = CS(\\vec{\\tau'})$ is checksum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c$ sends $M_{service}$ out. When bookkeepers verify $M_{service}$, they query $p$'s off-chain API with parameter $id_s'$ and its signiture, and get back  $\\vec{\\tau'}$, check if the checksum matches with $\\epsilon$. Record the $M_{service}$ into blockchain then. If any error, just ignore it. The next bookkeepers will try verify $M_{service}$ until $h_0+ h_e$ reached. If so,  $c$ can reinitiate $s$ again.\n",
    "\n",
    " $p$ only opens the GET API to the chain node (verified via signatures), and limit the number of queries for particular $id'_s$ with the maxmium confirmations necessary (say 6 for Bitcoin and 12 for Ethereum), except $c$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\vec{\\tau'}$ is encrypted, bookkeepers can do nothing with it except validation. $p$ can decrypt the data and excute the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Privacy with the service provider\n",
    "\n",
    "From 3.1 we can see SSK can provide good protection from the parites other than $c$ and $p$. But the question is: Is it possible to even protect the privacy from $p$? The answer is yes if the author of the service have a good design to split $\\vec{r}$ into subsets, create a set of service instances, and none of the providers can see the whole picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Endurance\n",
    "\n",
    "[TODO: Sharding verification. Order and answer already in $\\vec{a}$]\n",
    "\n",
    "Many services requires the providers to keep serving for a particular long time. e.g. $c$ wants to rent $p$'s storage to hold his video for one whole month. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, by defining extra parameter in $E_S$, we can have bookkeepers to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Verify $M_{resolve}$ whenever need to  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Example Scenarios  \n",
    "\n",
    " ### 4.1 Cloud mining \n",
    "\n",
    "$c$ wants to mine POW cryptocurrency $\\Gamma$, whose block cycle is larger than that of our network. $c$ finds there's a service called $S_{mine}$ to provide general mining service. So $\\vec{r_s} = (\\Gamma, B_h)$, while $\\Gamma$ is the symbol and $B_{h0}$ is the block content of height $h$. $D_{S_{mine}}$ returns standard hash function request, and $\\vec{a}$ is the nounce.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Gradient descent\n",
