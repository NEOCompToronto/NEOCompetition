* [NEOT White Paper](https://github.com/NEOCompToronto/NEOCompetition/blob/master/NEOT%20-%20White%20Paper.md): In this white paper, we first discuss the common challenge of distributed ledger based IoT projects, then introduce a new blockchain based service model PROV to help overcome some practical problems. The project NEOT (NEO of Things) is proposed to leveraged PROV service model and NEO blockchain. In the last, we describe some NEOT user cases.
